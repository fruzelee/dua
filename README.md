# <div align="center">**DUA COLLECTION**</div>

The Treasure of Paradise is a short dua that should be recited every day. Dua and Supplications are
forms of invocation in which a Muslim prays to his Lord for blessings. This is a collection of duas
from the Quran and authentic hadith that are extremely effective in shaping our Duniya and Akhirah.
These are excerpts from Treasure from Paradise, a collection of short dua that can be read in under
a minute.

# Benefit of our dhikr and good actions

“Any person’s excellent deeds would not make him join Paradise (i.e., no one enters paradise solely
through his good deeds),” declared the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). “Not even you?” the
Prophet’s companions inquired. “Not even myself,” the Prophet said, unless God bestows his favour
and mercy on me. So, in your religious actions, be moderate and do what you can. None of you should
yearn for death, for if he is a good person, he will be able to improve his good actions, and if he
is a bad person, he will be able to repent to God.” Volume 7, Hadith 577, Sahih al-Bukhari

# Treasure of Paradise

Allaah’s Messenger, SalAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, said:

Should I not tell you about a statement that is a gem from Paradise’s treasures? Yes, Messenger of
Allah, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you! I said. He stated, “Say:

# <div align="center">**لَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ**</div>

Transliteration: laa hawla wa laa quwwata Illaa billaah

Except for Allaah, there is neither capability nor power.

# <div align="center">*Daily Dhikr*</div>

# 1) Allah be pleased with you (Glory be to Allah)

# <div align="center">**سبحان الله**</div>

A thousand good deeds are recorded for him or a thousand negative deeds are wiped away for everyone who recites [the above] one hundred times.
[Muslim]

# 2) La illaha illallah Muhammadur Rasulullah (There is no God but Allah)

# <div align="center">**لا إله إلا الله محمد رسول الله**</div>

If we recite this dua one hundred times a day, we shall be rewarded with the release of ten slaves, the writing of 100 good actions, and the eradication of 100 bad deeds, and Satan will not attack us that day.

We can pronounce Laa ilaaha illa Allaah about 50 times in a minute. This is the most important word, since it is Tawheed, the excellent word, the word that endures. If they are a person’s last words, he will enter Paradise, and other tales illustrate how powerful these words are.
An La ilaha illallah, Li kulli shay’in miftahun wa miftahu al-jannati shahadatu. “Everything has a key, and witnessing that there is no deity but Allah is the key to Paradise.” Muqal ibn Yasar is narrated by Tabarani. According to one of the chapter titles in Bukhari’s Sahih, Wahb affirmed its veracity.

# 3) Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer

# <div align="center">**لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ يحي و يميت وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ**</div>

We can recite Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer – 20 times in one minute.

“Whoever says Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka Except for those who do more, no one can do anything better than what he has done. “Whoever says Subhaan Allaah wa bi hamdihi (Allaah be glorified and praise be to Him) one hundred times in a day will have his sins wiped, even if they are as small as the foam of the sea.” Al-Bukhaari and Muslim tell the storey.

# 4) Subhaan Allaah wa bi hamdihi Subhaan Allaah il-‘Azeem Subhaan Allaah wa bi hamdihi Subhaan Allaah il-‘Azeem

# <div align="center">**سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ**</div>

# <div align="center">**سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ الْعَظِيمِ**</div>

Subhaan Allaahi wa bi hamdihi Subhaan Allaah il-‘Azeem (Glory and praise be to Allaah, glory be to Allaah the Almighty) can be recited 50 times in one minute. According to al-Bukhaari and Muslim, they are two statements that are light on the tongue, heavy in the balance, and beloved of the Most Merciful.

“Shall I tell you the expression that Allah loves the most?” the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said to Abu Dharr (May Allah be pleased with him). It is ‘Subhan-Allahi wa bihamdihi’ (Allah is without flaws, and praise is due to Him)’.” [Muslim].

The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, “There are two phrases that are light for the tongue to recall, weighty in the Scales, and sweet to the Merciful: Subhan-Allahi wa bihamdihi, Subhan-Allahil-Azhim, Subhan-Allahi wa bihamdihi, Subhan-Allahi wa bihamdihi, Subhan-Allahi wa bihamdihi, Subhan [All glory and honour is due to Allah, and Allah, the Greatest, is without flaws)’.” [According to Al-Bukhari and Muslim].

“For him who says: Subhan-Allahi wa bi hamdihi (Allah is free from imperfection, and I begin by thanking Him, and to Him),” a palm-tree will be planted in Jannah, according to Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him).
[At-Tirmidhi].

“He who recites the statement: Subhan-Allahi wa bihamdihi (Allah is free from imperfection and I begin by praising Him) one hundred times in the morning and evening, will not be surpassed on the Day of Resurrection by anyone with better deeds than one who utters the same words or utters more of them,” according to Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him).
[Muslim].

Abu Huraira narrated: “Whoever says, ‘Subhan Allah wa bihamdihi,’ one hundred times a day will be forgiven all his sins, even if they are as great as the foam of the sea,” Allah’s Apostle declared. (Hadith #414, Book #75)
