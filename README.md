# <div align="center">**DUA COLLECTION**</div>

The Treasure of Paradise is a short dua that should be recited every day. Dua and Supplications are
forms of invocation in which a Muslim prays to his Lord for blessings. This is a collection of duas
from the Quran and authentic hadith that are extremely effective in shaping our Duniya and Akhirah.
These are excerpts from Treasure from Paradise, a collection of short dua that can be read in under
a minute.

# Benefit of our dhikr and good actions

“Any person’s excellent deeds would not make him join Paradise (i.e., no one enters paradise solely
through his good deeds),” declared the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). “Not even you?” the
Prophet’s companions inquired. “Not even myself,” the Prophet said, unless God bestows his favour
and mercy on me. So, in your religious actions, be moderate and do what you can. None of you should
yearn for death, for if he is a good person, he will be able to improve his good actions, and if he
is a bad person, he will be able to repent to God.” Volume 7, Hadith 577, Sahih al-Bukhari

# Treasure of Paradise

Allaah’s Messenger, SalAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, said:

Should I not tell you about a statement that is a gem from Paradise’s treasures? Yes, Messenger of
Allah, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you! I said. He stated, “Say:

# <div align="center">**لَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ**</div>

Transliteration: laa hawla wa laa quwwata Illaa billaah

Except for Allaah, there is neither capability nor power.

# <div align="center">*Daily Dhikr*</div>

# 1) Allah be pleased with you (Glory be to Allah)

# <div align="center">**سبحان الله**</div>

A thousand good deeds are recorded for him or a thousand negative deeds are wiped away for everyone who recites [the above] one hundred times.
[Muslim]

# 2) La illaha illallah Muhammadur Rasulullah (There is no God but Allah)

# <div align="center">**لا إله إلا الله محمد رسول الله**</div>

If we recite this dua one hundred times a day, we shall be rewarded with the release of ten slaves, the writing of 100 good actions, and the eradication of 100 bad deeds, and Satan will not attack us that day.

We can pronounce Laa ilaaha illa Allaah about 50 times in a minute. This is the most important word, since it is Tawheed, the excellent word, the word that endures. If they are a person’s last words, he will enter Paradise, and other tales illustrate how powerful these words are.
An La ilaha illallah, Li kulli shay’in miftahun wa miftahu al-jannati shahadatu. “Everything has a key, and witnessing that there is no deity but Allah is the key to Paradise.” Muqal ibn Yasar is narrated by Tabarani. According to one of the chapter titles in Bukhari’s Sahih, Wahb affirmed its veracity.

# 3) Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer

# <div align="center">**لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ يحي و يميت وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ**</div>

We can recite Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer – 20 times in one minute.

“Whoever says Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka Except for those who do more, no one can do anything better than what he has done. “Whoever says Subhaan Allaah wa bi hamdihi (Allaah be glorified and praise be to Him) one hundred times in a day will have his sins wiped, even if they are as small as the foam of the sea.” Al-Bukhaari and Muslim tell the storey.

# 4) Subhaan Allaah wa bi hamdihi Subhaan Allaah il-‘Azeem Subhaan Allaah wa bi hamdihi Subhaan Allaah il-‘Azeem

# <div align="center">**سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ**</div>

# <div align="center">**سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ الْعَظِيمِ**</div>

Subhaan Allaahi wa bi hamdihi Subhaan Allaah il-‘Azeem (Glory and praise be to Allaah, glory be to Allaah the Almighty) can be recited 50 times in one minute. According to al-Bukhaari and Muslim, they are two statements that are light on the tongue, heavy in the balance, and beloved of the Most Merciful.

“Shall I tell you the expression that Allah loves the most?” the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said to Abu Dharr (May Allah be pleased with him). It is ‘Subhan-Allahi wa bihamdihi’ (Allah is without flaws, and praise is due to Him)’.” [Muslim].

The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, “There are two phrases that are light for the tongue to recall, weighty in the Scales, and sweet to the Merciful: Subhan-Allahi wa bihamdihi, Subhan-Allahil-Azhim, Subhan-Allahi wa bihamdihi, Subhan-Allahi wa bihamdihi, Subhan-Allahi wa bihamdihi, Subhan [All glory and honour is due to Allah, and Allah, the Greatest, is without flaws)’.” [According to Al-Bukhari and Muslim].

“For him who says: Subhan-Allahi wa bi hamdihi (Allah is free from imperfection, and I begin by thanking Him, and to Him),” a palm-tree will be planted in Jannah, according to Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him).
[At-Tirmidhi].

“He who recites the statement: Subhan-Allahi wa bihamdihi (Allah is free from imperfection and I begin by praising Him) one hundred times in the morning and evening, will not be surpassed on the Day of Resurrection by anyone with better deeds than one who utters the same words or utters more of them,” according to Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him).
[Muslim].

Abu Huraira narrated: “Whoever says, ‘Subhan Allah wa bihamdihi,’ one hundred times a day will be forgiven all his sins, even if they are as great as the foam of the sea,” Allah’s Apostle declared. (Hadith #414, Book #75)

# 5) Subhaan Allaah, wa’l-hamdu Lillah, wa laa ilaah ill-Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar

# <div align="center">**,سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَالْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ وَلاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَاللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ**</div>

“When I say ‘Subhaan Allaah, wa’l-hamdu Lillah, wa laa ilaah ill-Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar (Glory be to Allaah, praise be to Allaah, there is no god save Allaah, and Allaah is Most Great), this is more beloved to me than all that the sun rises upon,” the Prophet (peace and blessings of Alla (Muslim tells the storey.) We can pronounce all of these words more than 18 times in one minute. These are Allaah’s favourite words, the best of words, and they count heavily in the balance of good acts, as the saheeh ahaadeeth narrated.

# 6)Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah

# <div align="center">**لَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللَّهُِ**</div>

We can chant Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah (There is no strength and no power except with Allaah) around 40 times in one minute. According to al-Bukhaari and Muslim, this is one of the treasures of Paradise. They are a means of persevering in the face of adversity and striving for greatness.

# 7) SubhanAlaah,Alhumdulillah,Allahuakbar

After each salah/namaj, we read this 33 times each.

Subhanallah

# <div align="center">**سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ**</div>

The Prophet (SAW) said that whomever reads Subhanallah 100 times in the morning and 100 times in the evening will be rewarded in the same way as someone who performs 100 Hajj.

Alhamdulillah

# <div align="center">**الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ**</div>

The Prophet (SAW) declared that reading Alhamdulillah 100 times is equivalent to participating in 100 Jihads.
Jame Tirmizi (Jame Tirmizi)

Allahuakbar

# <div align="center">**اللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ**</div>

On the Day of Judgment, no one will be able to bring more good acts than whoever reads Allahuakbar 100 times in the morning and 100 times in the evening, except the one who has read more.

# 8) Subhaan Allaah wa bi hamdih, ‘adada khalqihi, wa ridaa nafsihi, wazinata ‘arshihi, wa midaada kalimaatihi, wamidaada kalimaatihi, wamidaada kalimaatihi, wamidaada kalimaatihi,

# <div align="center">**سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ**</div>
# <div align="center">**عَدَدَ خَلْقِهِ**</div>
# <div align="center">**رِضَا نَفْسِهِ**</div>
# <div align="center">**وَزِنَةَ عَرْشِهِ**</div>
# <div align="center">**وَ مِدَادَ كَلِمَاتِهِ**</div>

Subhaan Allaah wa bi hamdih, ‘adada khalqihi, wa ridaa nafsihi, wazinata ‘arshihi, wa midaada kalimaatihi (Glory and praise be to Allaah, as much as the number of His creation, as much as what pleases Him, as much as the weight of His Throne, and as much as the ink of As recorded in saheeh ahaadeeth from the Prophet, these words bring several times the reward for other forms of tasbeeh and dhikr (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).

# 9) Astaghfir-Allaah

# <div align="center">**أَسْتَغْفِرُ اللّٰهَ**</div>

We can seek Allaah’s pardon more than 100 times in one minute by saying “Astaghfir-Allaah” (I seek the forgiveness of Allaah). The benefits of seeking forgiveness are well known, as it is a means of receiving forgiveness and joining Paradise, as well as improving one’s strength, warding off disasters, making things easier, bringing rain, and increasing one’s wealth and offspring.

# 10) Pray for the Prophet’s well-being (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)

# <div align="center">**اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ، وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ، إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ، اللَّهُمَّ بَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ، وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ، إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ**</div>

By chanting Sall-Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam 50 times in one minute, we can send blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (May Allaah bless him and grant him peace). In exchange, Allaah will shower you with blessings 500 hundred times over, for one blessing brings ten more.

# 11) SAY THIS DUA, ALLAH GIVES YOU RIZQ FAST

# <div align="center">**اللَّهُمَّ إنِّي أَسْأَلُك مِنْ فَضْلِكَ وَرَحْمَتِكَ، فَإِنَّهُ لاَ يَمْلِكُهَا إِلاَّ أَنْتَ**</div>
