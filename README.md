# Benefit of our dhikr and good actions

“Any person’s excellent deeds would not make him join Paradise (i.e., no one enters paradise solely
through his good deeds),” declared the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). “Not even you?” the
Prophet’s companions inquired. “Not even myself,” the Prophet said, unless God bestows his favour
and mercy on me. So, in your religious actions, be moderate and do what you can. None of you should
yearn for death, for if he is a good person, he will be able to improve his good actions, and if he
is a bad person, he will be able to repent to God.” Volume 7, Hadith 577, Sahih al-Bukhari
