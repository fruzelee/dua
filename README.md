a minute.

# Benefit of our dhikr and good actions

“Any person’s excellent deeds would not make him join Paradise (i.e., no one enters paradise solely
through his good deeds),” declared the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). “Not even you?” the
Prophet’s companions inquired. “Not even myself,” the Prophet said, unless God bestows his favour
and mercy on me. So, in your religious actions, be moderate and do what you can. None of you should
yearn for death, for if he is a good person, he will be able to improve his good actions, and if he
is a bad person, he will be able to repent to God.” Volume 7, Hadith 577, Sahih al-Bukhari

# Treasure of Paradise

Allaah’s Messenger, SalAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, said:

Should I not tell you about a statement that is a gem from Paradise’s treasures? Yes, Messenger of
Allah, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you! I said. He stated, “Say:

# <div align="center">**لَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ**</div>

Transliteration: laa hawla wa laa quwwata Illaa billaah

Except for Allaah, there is neither capability nor power.

### SAY THIS DUA, ALLAH GIVES YOU RIZQ FAST

# <div align="center">**اللَّهُمَّ إنِّي أَسْأَلُك مِنْ فَضْلِكَ وَرَحْمَتِكَ، فَإِنَّهُ لاَ يَمْلِكُهَا إِلاَّ أَنْتَ**</div>

### <div align="center">*Allahumma innee as’aluka min fadlika wa rahmatika, fa-innahu laa yam-liku-ha illaa ant*</div>

(O Allah indeed I ask of You for Your Virtue (Bounty) and Your Mercy, for indeed, no one possesses
these except You.’)
